# Andamiro boards

## MK1

The oldest piece of hardware we have seen in the wild was a MK3 board so far. But there are several hints that
some piece of hardware pre-dating the MK3 existed at some point:

* The first three Pump It Up games, [1st](game/piu/1st.md), [2nd](game/piu/2nd.md) and [3rd/OBG](game/piu/3rd.md),\
  are storing their music as actual CD audio, not MP3 files in the data area of the discs
* MP3 hardware decoder chips were likely not cheap/easily available at that time. Furthermore, the total audio length
  of all songs still fit onto the disc as CD audio tracks
* The first three Pump It Up games did not use a lock-chip as a means for copy-protection. Possible,
  that this piece of hardware wasn't available from the beginning and therefore not used

### MK1 compatible games

* [Pump it Up: The 1st Dance Floor](game/piu/1st.md)
* [Pump it Up: The 2nd Dance Floor](game/piu/2nd.md)
* [Pump it Up The O.B.G: The 3rd Dance Floor](game/piu/3rd.md)

## MK3

* Custom PCB assembly with daughter boards stacked
* DOS OS stored on ROM chip
* Games stored and loaded from CD
* [PIUIO](io.md#mk3io) interface connected via ISA Bus
* Hardware audio decoder chip for MP3 audio
* CAT702 ZN security "Lock chip" for copy-protection
* EEPROM to store game settings
